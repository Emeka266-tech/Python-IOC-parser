<h2>Python script for parsing security logs and extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs)</h2>

<h2>A cybersecurity python project that reads log files and extracts indicators of compromise(IOCs) such as IP addresses from raw logs.</h2>

<h2>This project demonstrates how security analysts read logs and identify suspicious indicators using Python.</h2>


<h2>Project Objective</h2>

The objective of this project is to:

.Read a log file using Python

.Analyze the content

.Extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

.Display the results clearly 


This simulates a basic SOC (Security Operations Center) task.

<h2>Tools and Technologies used.</h2>

. Python 3

. Regular expressions

. File handling 

. Cybersecurity fundamentals


<h2>This project was created using Pycharm as a python project</h2>

Files created:

.ioc_parser.py - python script

.project_logs.txt - sample log file


<h2>Step 1: create a sample log file</h2>

A text file containing simulated log entries was created to represent real-world security logs.

<h2>Step 3: read the log file</h2>


The Python script opens the log file and reads its content into memory so it can be analyzed.

<h2>Step 4: Extract indicators of compromise</h2>

Regular expressions were used to extract IP addresses from the log content.

<h2>This project demonstrates the ability to apply Python to real-world cybersecurity tasks by reading security logs, extracting Indicators of Compromise, and presenting actionable results in a clear and documented manner.</h2>

<h2>Lesson learned.</h2>

. Understanding comes before automation

. File handling is foundational

. scripts only do what they are explicitly told

. Attention to file parts and naming matters

. Pattern based detection is central to security analysis

. Output verification is part of development

. Documentation adds credibility
